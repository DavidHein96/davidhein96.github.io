Welcome to my site! I just graduated with my Master's degree in data science and I have a background in academic medical research. My projects at the radiation oncology department at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center involve a wide array of techniques in statistics, machine learning, and bioinformatics. I have a strong foundation in statistical analysis and programming an am seeking to leverage these skills to advance ambitious projects in a dynamic, data-driven role.
