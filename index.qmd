Welcome to my site! I just graduated with my MS in data science and have a background in academic medical research. My work involves a full stack of end-to-end skills, from utilizing efficient data structures, assessing bioinformatics tools, navigating clinical healthcare workflows, writing academic manuscripts, to the final communication of findings to stakeholders. Outside of my current position I'm interested in learning to maximize the utility of large language models, and love teaching people what I've found!

# Technical Skills & Projects

Check out [my projects](projects.qmd), which are tagged with technical skill categories. As a bonus, here's my [introductory guide](posts/chatGPT_book/index.qmd) to ChatGPT. Many of my coding projects for my degree and my research position are in private repositories, feel free to reach out for more information regarding code samples.
